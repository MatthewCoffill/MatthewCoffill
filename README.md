- 👋 Hi, I’m @MatthewCoffill
- 👀 I’m interested in extending my limited knowledge of coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to connect my code to databases (taking it slow).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing atm.
- 📫 How to reach me (that's not going to happen until I feel I can collaborate on anything).
